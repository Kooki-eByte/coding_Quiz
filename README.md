# Coding Quiz

A timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## How this web app works

- We have a starting point with a start game button.
- Once the start game button is pressed it will start the javascript code.
- The code will pop the first question from the array object, for every answer button pressed it will keep going down the the list of questions until the user gets them all or the timer runs out.
- Once the timer runs out or the questions are all answered it will pop the score the user has gotten and then it will ask if the user wants to submit a name or just reset.

## Known problems

1. When the user displays no name we want it to not print anything until a user does.

2. Add on a delete a user so it can clear out the array to show the user can always be in 1st place ;)

## Contribution

This is all open to contributions, Please leave desciptive commit message to what your code does.
